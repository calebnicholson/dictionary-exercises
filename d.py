# Exercise 1

a = {"puella":"girl","pulchra":"pretty","puer":"boy","fortis":"strong"}

# write the expression that will retrieve the word 'pretty'.

# write the expression that will retrieve the word 'boy'.

# write the expression that will add a new key-value pair
# consisting of the key 'laborare' and the value 'to work'

# Exercise 2

b = {"billy":{},"bobby":{"HW1":96},"barry":{"HW1":97.7}}

# Who didn't turn an assignment in?

# How would I update that person's grade for that assignment
# to a 85.4?

# Add another assignment 'HW2' with the grades 79,89,85
# respectively for 'billy','bobby', and 'barry'.

# Add another student 'bonny', and give her grade 100, and 99
# for assignments 'HW1', and 'HW2' respectively.
